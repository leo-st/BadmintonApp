## Features

### Soft Deletes
- Posts and comments use soft deletes (is_deleted flag) instead of hard deletes
- This preserves data integrity and allows for potential recovery

### Nested Comments
- Comments can have parent comments, allowing for threaded discussions
- Replies are automatically loaded when fetching comments

### Reaction System
- Users can react to both posts and comments with emojis
- Each user can only have one reaction per emoji per post/comment
- Reaction counts are automatically calculated and included in responses

### File Attachments
- Support for multiple file types (images, videos, documents, links, GIFs, audio)
- Metadata storage for additional file information
- Files can be attached to both posts and comments

### Pagination
- All list endpoints support pagination with `skip` and `limit` parameters
- Default limits are set to prevent performance issues

### Authorization
- All endpoints require authentication
- Users can only edit/delete their own posts and comments
- File attachments can only be added to posts by the post author

## Database Migration

To apply the database changes, run the SQL migration file:

```sql
-- The migration is located at:
-- db/postgres/init/010_create_posts_system.sql
```

This will create all the necessary tables, indexes, and constraints for the posts system.

## Next Steps

1. **File Upload Handling**: Implement actual file upload endpoints for handling file attachments
2. **Image Processing**: Add image resizing and optimization for uploaded images
3. **Notification System**: Add notifications for new posts, comments, and reactions
4. **Search**: Add search functionality for posts and comments
5. **Hashtags**: Add hashtag support for categorizing posts
6. **Mentions**: Add user mention functionality in posts and comments
7. **Feed Algorithm**: Implement a more sophisticated feed algorithm (chronological, engagement-based, etc.)
